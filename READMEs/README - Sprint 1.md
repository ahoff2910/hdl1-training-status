<h3>Sprint Review</h3>
<p>1. We learned that the most important part of the sprint is the planning part. We met as a group for multiple hours to develop our plan for the sprint and break down the tasks that we needed to complete over the duration of the sprint. Although the planning seemed tedious at the time, it helped to align the team with the goals of the sprint. 
</p>
<p>2. Our time management and completion of our sprint goals went well. We did a good job budgeting our time over the week.</p>
<p>3. We could have taken on more tasks during the sprint. </p>
<p>4. I think next time we can plan ahead a little better. For our next sprint, I think we will commit to setting higher goals to be completed by the end of the sprint. This time, I think we all felt that we went under budget on our hours. </p>
<p>5. We are satisfied with what we have completed, it is in line with the mockup we created and is an accurate representation of what the client requested in the product.</p>
<p>6. Below is the feedback provided to Group 3:
    <p>Things Group 3 did well:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Their Trello board was laid out neatly and effectively</li>
        <li>Listing out practical user stories and linking those stories to your task breakdown chart</li>
        <li>Creating a robust task breakdown chart, and linking that to your Trello</li>
        <li>Adding detailed descriptions in your Scrum meetings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Things Group 3 could imporve on:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attaching/adjusting the margin on your burndown chart pictures</li>
        <li>Completing your Scrum meeting notes</li>
        <li>Incorporating CSS / JS to your website, or if they have done that, commit the changes to GitHub for review</li>
    </ul>

Great work! </p>
