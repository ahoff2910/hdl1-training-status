<h3>Sprint Review</h3>
<p>a. What did you learn during the sprint?: During this sprint we learned the importance of constant user feedback. We created mockups for the client and after meeting with the client they had suggestions. This allowed us to develop the application to the clients specification.</p>
<p>b. What did go well? Why?: We are happy with the progress we have completed. We think that our implementation of firebase and user authentication went well. We were able to set up different user permissions which allows our client to control who has access to what resources on the application. </p>
<p>c. What didn't go well? Why not?: This sprint we took on more work so we didn't complete our work according to the burndown chart. We were a little off track during the middle of the week, but by the end of the week we got back on track and were able to get everything done. </p>
<p>d. How can you make things better next time?:</p>
<p>e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?: We are satisfied with what we have completed. We have taken the users suggestions in from the last sprint and applied them to the application during this sprint. We have completed the whole graphical interface and completed a good portion of the user authentication within firebase as well. </p>
