<P><a href= "https://github.com/ahoff2910/hdl1-training-status">Link to Public Repository</a></P>
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<p>1. As a developer, meet with clients and receive feedback to alter training sites to clients desires. </p>
<p>2. As a user I want to have an easy to use interface which is visually appealing.</p>
<p>3. As a user I want to be able to view employees who are actively offboarding and inactive to make sure that terminated employees have completed all offboarding tasks.

        <h3>Sprint Review</h3>
        <p>1. What did we learn: We learned the importance of communicating what tasks we want to complete so that we all are on the same page going into the sprint and know what the goals of the sprint are.</p>
        <p>2. What went well: We were able to complete all of our work and able to create the site to the clients specifications. </p>
        <p>3. What didn't go well: We didn't follow a typical burndown schedule, because all of the members of our group were busy so it is hard to stick to the typical burndown pattern, especially with the midterm this week.</p>
        <p>4. How can we make things better: We can communicate more about what days people will be working on tasks to attempt to make our burndown chart more uniform. </p>
        <p>5. Are you satisfied with what has been completed: Yes we are satisfied. We have our whole graphical interface complete, with most parts of our site connected to the Database. We are in a good spot and should be able to complete all of our work in the last sprint.</p>
